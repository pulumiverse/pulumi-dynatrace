/**
 * > **Dynatrace SaaS only**
 *
 * > To utilize this resource, please define the environment variables `DT_CLIENT_ID`, `DT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DT_ACCOUNT_ID` with an OAuth client including the following permissions: **Allow IAM policy configuration for environments** (`iam-policies-management`) and **View environments** (`account-env-read`).
 *
 * You can use the attributes `environments`, `accounts` and `globals` to refine which policies you want to query for.
 * * The attribute `global` indicates whether the results should also contain global (Dynatrace defined) policies
 * * The attribute `environment` is an array of environment IDs.
 * * The results won't contain any environment specific policies if the attribute `environments` has been omitted
 * * The results will contain policies for all environments reachable via the given credentials if `environments` is set to `["*"]`
 * * The attribute `accounts` is an array of accounts UUIDs. Set this to `["*"]` if you want to receive account specific policies.
 * * The results won't contain any account specific policies if the attribute `accounts` has been omitted
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example queries for polices of all environments reachable via the given credentials, all accounts and all global policies.
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as dynatrace from "@pulumiverse/dynatrace";
 *
 * const all = dynatrace.getIamPolicies({
 *     environments: ["*"],
 *     accounts: ["*"],
 *     global: true,
 * });
 * ```
 * The following example queries for policies that are defined for the environment with the id `abce234`. No account specific or global policies will be included.
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as dynatrace from "@pulumiverse/dynatrace";
 *
 * const all = dynatrace.getIamPolicies({
 *     environments: ["abce234"],
 *     global: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example Output
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as dynatrace from "@pulumiverse/dynatrace";
 *
 * const all = dynatrace.getIamPolicies({
 *     environments: ["*"],
 *     accounts: ["*"],
 *     global: true,
 * });
 * export const policies = all.then(all => all.policies);
 * ```
