This approach ensures complete insight into your applicationâ€™s performance and customer experience. You can optionally reduce the granularity of user-action and user-session analysis by capturing a lower percentage of user sessions. While this approach can reduce monitoring costs, it also results in lower visibility into how your customers are using your applications. For example, a setting of 10% results in Dynatrace analyzing only every tenth user session.
